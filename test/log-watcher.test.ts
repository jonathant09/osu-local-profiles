 *     Assertion failed: !_wcsnicmp(filename, dir, dirlen), file src\win\fs-event.c, line 72

 * `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`, which is exactly what a GitHub runner's TEMP is. It is an abort
 * inside the runtime rather than an error, so there is nothing to catch: the process dies,
 * which is how this took two unrelated test files down with it and why nothing here caught
 * it first.
 *
 * That exact condition cannot be manufactured on a machine whose temp directory is already
 * canonical, so what is pinned here is the fix rather than the crash: `watchablePath` must
 * hand `fs.watch` the resolved path. A junction is the same class of mismatch and is
 * something a real user can have -- an osu! folder moved to another drive and linked back
