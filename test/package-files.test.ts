 * a Node this app would not use anyway.
 *
 * Verified by running all three launchers against folders in each state; what those runs
 * cannot check is the executable-bit branch, because NTFS reports every file as executable.
 * `sh -n` parses it, and only a real unix filesystem can exercise it -- the same standing
 * caveat as the rest of the macOS and Linux packaging.
