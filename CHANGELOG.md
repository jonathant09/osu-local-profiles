# Changelog

## 1.18.0

- **Import past plays can ignore your play tracking filter.** A new tick box, on by default, so
  an import is judged exactly as live tracking would judge it. Untick it and every play found
  is imported -- useful for an evening you played before the filter existed, or under different
  rules. Before, the only way was to turn the filter off, import, and turn it back on.
  - The box is re-ticked each time the dialog opens, so bypassing the filter never leaks into
    live tracking.
  - Underneath it, a line says what it will do -- and if you have no filter yet, it offers to
    take you to **Options -> Play tracking filter** to make one.

- **Replays you watched are no longer counted as your own plays.** osu! saves the replays you
  watch in the same folders as the ones you set, so Import past plays could fill a profile with
  other people's scores -- on the machine this was found on, 88 plays by 62 players, enough to
  read 16,109pp instead of 7,394.
  - Plays set by someone else are not tracked, and the import dialog names them so you can see
    what it left out.
  - Plays already tracked that were somebody else's are removed once, automatically. They are
    **removed, not deleted**: they sit in Options -> Other settings -> Removed scores and go
    back with one click.
  - That clean-up only runs for a profile linked to an osu! account, so it can check your
    previous usernames too. **A play set before you renamed is yours and is kept**, as is a
    play made signed out (osu!stable records no name) or offline in osu!lazer.
  - **Offline plays are kept whatever name you gave yourself.** osu!stable lets you type any
    username into its settings, so an offline play might say `Cat` -- or even a real player's
    name. What tells the two apart is not the name: a replay you downloaded is a score osu!
    put on a leaderboard and carries osu!'s id for it, and a play osu! never received has
    none. Anything osu! never received was set on your machine, so it is yours.

- **Import your best performances and pinned scores from osu!.** Two new boxes in
  **Options -> Import from osu!**, and in the welcome on a brand-new install. Brings in up to
  200 best performances per game mode with osu!'s own pp, so the profile's pp and accuracy
  match your osu! profile, and pins the scores you pinned there in the same order. Plays set
  on another PC, or on beatmaps you no longer have installed, come across too -- osu! has them
  even when this computer does not.
  - Both start unticked: they are the only part of an import that adds plays.
  - **Import past plays afterwards will not add any of them twice.** A score is matched to its
    replay by osu!'s own id, and for replays too old to carry one, by the beatmap, the exact
    score, the combo and the time.
  - Bonus pp is taken from your osu! profile, because it is earned over every ranked map you
    have ever played rather than over your top scores. Hovering the pp figure says so. As you
    track or import real plays, your own bonus takes over.

- **Plays set while the app is closed are no longer tracked.** Closing the app is how tracking
  is stopped, so plays made after that stay out of the profile -- the app picks up from the
  moment it opens, not from where it left off. Turning tracking off and on again works the same
  way. To bring those plays in anyway, use **Options -> Import past plays**, which asks for a
  cutoff and shows what it would add before anything is written.

## 1.17.0

- **No more console window.** The app now lives in the system tray on Windows and Linux, and in
  the menu bar on macOS, with no Dock icon. Open it with **osu! local profiles.exe** on Windows,
  **osu! local profiles** on macOS, or **./osu-local-profiles** on Linux.
  - The icon's menu has **Open profile**, **Open log** and **Quit**. On Windows and Linux,
    clicking it opens the page.
  - What the app prints is now in `data/logs/app.log`.
  - Windows 11 puts a new tray icon behind the **^** arrow; drag it onto the taskbar to keep it
    in view.
  - On Linux, a desktop with no tray (GNOME without the AppIndicator extension) runs it with no
    icon. With no desktop, `./start.sh` runs it in the terminal as before.
- **Quit from the page.** **Quit** at the top right stops the app, after asking once.
- **Starting it again opens the page.** Starting the app while it runs no longer fails on the
  port: it opens the running copy's page. That is how to get back to the page if you lose it.
  When the page loses the app, it says so and picks up again once the app is back.
- **Remove an unfinished play.** Didn't finish and Not submitted rows in Recent Plays have
  **Remove from profile**, which takes them out of the play count too. A collapsed row removes
  every attempt in it. They are listed in Other settings -> Removed scores, where they can be put
  back or deleted for good.
- **Updating from 1.16.0 or earlier.** Update from the app as usual; it comes back in the tray.
  On Windows, `Start osu! local profiles.bat` is replaced by `osu! local profiles.exe`, so move
  any shortcut you made. Windows may ask once whether to run the unrecognised app: press **More
  info**, then **Run anyway**.

## 1.16.0

- **The Options menu is down to six entries.** Import past plays and Play tracking filter sit
  under a **Tracking** heading. **Share & back up** is one dialog for saving the page, saving
  an image, exporting the profile as JSON and backing up the database. **Reset** moved into
  Profiles, at the end of Edit profile, since it only touches the profile being tracked, and
  **Open in browser on start** moved into Other settings, under This install.

## 1.15.0

- **Options is shorter, and Profiles holds everything about a profile.** Edit profile, Import
  from osu! and Keep Favorite Beatmaps the same on every profile are now parts of **Profiles**,
  below the profile list, and a profile's country and playstyle are edited there instead of in
  Settings. Settings is now **Other settings**, and no option ends in "..." any more.
- **A score's menu stays with its score.** The menu from a score's **...** button stayed on the
  same spot on screen while the page scrolled; it now moves with the row it belongs to.
- **macOS asks for one approval instead of many.** A download's files are quarantined, and
  macOS refused the pp calculator and each of its libraries separately, one trip to Privacy &
  Security at a time. Now only the launcher needs **Open Anyway**: it lifts the quarantine from
  the rest of its own folder before starting the app. The instructions are updated for macOS
  15, where right-click -> Open no longer gets past the block. Allowing apps from anywhere is
  not needed.
- **A welcome on first launch offers to bring in an osu! account.** A brand-new install shows
  Import from osu! once, marked optional, with the account osu! is signed in as
  already suggested and the same choice of avatar, banner, flag, me! and favorite beatmaps.
  Skip, the close button, Escape or clicking outside it all dismiss it for good, and it stays
  under Options -> Profiles. An install updated from an earlier version never sees it.
- **Which mods are ranked now comes from osu! itself.** A hand-kept list was missing lazer's
  newer ranked mods -- Alternate, Single Tap, Traceable, Blinds, No Scope, Accuracy Challenge,
  Muted, Swap, Cover, Fade In and 4K-9K -- so those plays counted only with **Include pp for
  unranked mods** on. It also counted Classic chosen on lazer, Mirror outside mania and Hard Rock
  in mania, none of which osu! ranks, and treated any changed setting as unranking: a changed
  pitch on Double Time, or Sudden Death set to restart, keeps a play ranked in osu!. The pp
  calculator is now asked, per game mode and setting. Scores tracked before this are offered a
  recompute in Other settings, which re-checks them -- including scores whose replay is gone.

## 1.14.0

- **Plays osu! could not submit can count** (Settings -> Count plays osu! could not submit).
  Quits, fails and retries while osu! is offline or signed out used to leave no trace, because
  osu! counts nothing it cannot submit. They are now read from osu!lazer's own log -- only where
  the game says, in as many words, that it had no token -- and count by default toward the play
  count, monthly play counts, Most Played, Recent Plays (labelled "Not submitted") and Total Play
  Time together. osu! never received them, so this takes nothing away from your osu! profile;
  turn it off to match that profile exactly. Works without osu!lazer's online beatmap database.
- **Import past plays reads osu!lazer's logs too**, so a past session comes back whole: finished
  plays from their replays, and the quits, fails and retries osu! counted or could not submit.
  Each kind is its own tick box with its count, so past offline attempts can be brought in
  without past replays.
- **Beatmaps with a `[` in their details are read correctly.** A mapper called
  `cRyo[iceeicee]`, a title tagged `[CV. ...]` or an audio file named `[HD] ...` used to cut a
  beatmap's details short. On one real library that lost 327 beatmap names and put 23 beatmaps
  -- and any unfinished plays on them -- under the wrong game mode.
- **Updating no longer leaves the app running where it cannot be stopped.** On macOS and
  Linux the app came back from **Update** with no terminal: it kept tracking and holding its
  port, and closing the terminal did not stop it. It now comes back in the terminal it was
  started from, where Ctrl+C and closing the window stop it as before. The first update to this
  version is carried out by the old launcher, so that once it opens a new terminal window
  instead -- or, on Linux with no desktop or no terminal program it can find, leaves the app
  closed and says in `data/update.log` to start it again. On Windows, the window the app came
  back in stayed open at a prompt after the app stopped; it now closes with it.
- **Unfinished plays are tracked without osu!lazer's online beatmap database**, which is
  commonly missing on Linux: the beatmap is found from its own file instead. A play also stays
  open when osu!lazer logs leaving gameplay before its submission completes. Contributed in #1.
- **A pass whose submission finishes after the results screen stays a pass.** Leaving results
  used to mark it unfinished and count it a second time beside its own replay.
- **Hidden tabs let go of the live feed**, so several open tabs no longer stall the page.

## 1.13.2

- **The launcher says when the folder is incomplete**, instead of failing with a message that
  looks like a missing prerequisite. Nothing in this app needs installing -- the runtime ships
  inside the folder -- so a missing file means the download or the extraction did not finish,
  or antivirus took something. The launcher now names what is missing, says that plainly, and
  links to the downloads. On macOS and Linux it also spots a runtime that lost its executable
  bit in transit, and gives the `chmod +x` that restores it.

## 1.13.1

- **The accuracy is centred in its cell again** in Pinned Scores and Recent Plays. Only Best
  Performance has a "weighted x%" line under the accuracy; the other two sections were
  aligning as though they did, which left their accuracy sitting 9px above the pp beside it.

## 1.13.0

- **Play tracking filter** (Options): choose which plays this profile records at all, by
  keyword, mode, star rating, mods, category, length and the dates a beatmap was added,
  submitted and ranked. Off by default, and switching it on changes nothing until you narrow
  something -- every criterion starts wide open.
  - **Mods have three states**, not a checkbox: a mod may be used, must be used, or must not
    be used. Every mod in all four modes is there, and the dialog prints what the current
    selection means in a sentence, so a grid of sixty-seven badges never has to be read as a
    rule. There is a nomod badge too, for "only nomod plays" or "never a nomod play".
  - **A play the filter turns away is not recorded at all** -- no score, no pp, no play
    count -- and cannot be brought back, so the app says so every time: a line in the console,
    a message on the page naming the criterion, a count in the Options menu, and a mark on the
    menu entry while a filter is on.
  - **Import past plays applies it too**, and says how many it would leave out. Switch the
    filter off first to bring in everything.
  - Plays you quit, failed or retried are matched on the seven criteria that can judge them:
    osu!lazer records no mods and no star rating for a play it discards.
  - With osu!stable and no osu!lazer, the category and the two submission dates have no source
    on the machine, and those three sections say so.

## 1.12.0

- **Two scoring scales, as osu! has them**: Options -> Lazer scoring, on by default. On, a
  nomod SS is 1,000,000; off, scores read on the uncapped classic scale -- what stable
  recorded for a stable play, and osu!'s own classic conversion for a lazer one. Both are
  stored per score, so switching is instant, and it moves the rows, the cards, Total Score,
  Ranked Score and the level together.
- **osu!stable scores are listed with the Classic mod**, exactly as osu! lists them.
- **An osu!stable-only install now counts pp.** Only osu!lazer ships the database that says
  whether a beatmap is ranked, so without it every beatmap used to count as unranked and the
  profile scored zero. Every beatmap now counts instead, with a note in Scores saying why and
  the beatmap-status settings dimmed, since there is nothing to filter on.
- **A moved osu!stable Songs folder is found**, by reading stable's own BeatmapDirectory
  setting instead of assuming the default location.
- **A note wherever osu!stable is found**, in Recent Plays and Scores: a stable score reaches
  the page when you leave the results screen, and plays you quit, failed or retried are not
  counted at all, because stable keeps no record of them. Both were measured on a real stable
  install; the evidence is in docs/roadmap.md 5.12.

## 1.11.0

- **me! is written the way osu!'s is**: BBCode, with osu!'s own toolbar (Bold, Italic,
  Strike Out, Header, Link, Spoiler Box, lists, Image, Image Map, Font Size), a Preview, and
  images pasted or dropped straight into the box. Anything that is not one of osu!'s tags
  shows as the characters typed, so a page imported from any osu! profile is safe to show.
- **Import from osu!** (Options): look an account up and copy what you tick -- avatar,
  banner, flag and me! by default, favorite beatmaps on request. Never automatic; nothing is
  asked of osu.ppy.sh until you press a button.
- **Favorite Beatmaps is one list for every profile** by default (Settings -> Every
  profile). Switching either way loses nothing. An empty list says how to fill it, with an
  Import button and Don't show again.
- **Removed scores can be deleted for good**: a red minus per score, and Delete all
  permanently. Their replays are never imported again.
- **The web page export works like the page**: show more, the mode tabs, View Details,
  the medal cards and the previews all respond, from one file with no app behind it. It
  holds nothing about your computer, so it can be put online as a sample profile; the README
  says how.

## 1.10.0

- **Recent Plays is a section of its own**, near the top of the page under me!, instead of
  a part of Historical. The Recent feed -- medals, new bests and levels -- is now called
  **Milestones** and sits under Historical. A page you have rearranged yourself keeps its
  arrangement; one you never touched gets the new order.
- **View Details shows the pp breakdown**: how much of a score's pp came from aim, speed,
  accuracy and flashlight (taiko: difficulty and accuracy; mania: difficulty), exactly as
  osu!'s own calculator splits it. Older scores get theirs the first time they are opened.
- **You can see which osu! release priced your pp**: in the footer, in Settings, and on
  each score's card. When osu! reworks pp and a newer calculator ships, Settings says how
  many scores were priced by an older one and recalculates them with one button.
- **Mod Introduction medals**: the thirteen medals osu! gives for your first pass with a mod
  -- Easy, No Fail, Half Time, Hard Rock, Sudden Death, Perfect, Double Time, Nightcore,
  Hidden, Flashlight and Spun Out, plus the lazer-only Conversion and Fun medals -- judged by
  osu!'s own rules, from passes in any mode.
- **macOS and Linux downloads.** Every release now has a build for Windows, macOS (Apple
  silicon) and Linux, made on each system by GitHub Actions.
- **Updates on macOS and Linux keep their files executable.** The updater unpacked the app
  without the permission bits, so an update there would have relaunched nothing. (Windows has
  no such bits and was never affected.)

## 1.9.0

- **The page opens straight away on a first launch.** The app used to read your whole osu!
  folder before showing anything -- a few seconds on some machines, possibly an hour on a
  very large library -- with nothing but a line in the console to say why. It now does that
  in the background, with a progress bar at the top of the page. Scores you set meanwhile
  are held and added, with pp, as soon as it finishes; nothing is lost or left without pp.
- **osu!stable: indexing opens only beatmap files.** It used to open every file in `Songs`
  -- audio, backgrounds, hitsounds -- to check whether it was a beatmap.

## 1.8.1

- **The Windows launcher always starts the app's own Node runtime.** It named `node.exe`
  without a path, which Windows only looks for in the app's folder while a security setting
  (NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath) is off. With it on, the app started on whatever Node
  was installed on the computer -- possibly one too old to run it -- or failed to start.

## 1.8.0

- **The profile page is much faster on a big profile.** On a profile of 20,000 scores a page
  load took about a second, and so did every "show more" -- the page recalculated every
  total, medal and chart each time. The first load is now about half that, and every request
  after it answers in a few milliseconds until something actually changes.
- **The download is 2.6MB smaller**: a set of TypeScript declarations was being shipped with
  the app's one dependency, and nothing ever used them.
- **View Details**, from the **...** menu on any score in Scores or Recent Plays: the score
  as osu!'s own score page shows it, in a card over the profile. The beatmap and its
  difficulty, the cover, the grade tower, osu!'s accuracy dial -- or the big grade letter for a
  score set on osu!stable, as on osu! -- the mods, total score, when and on which client it was
  played, and accuracy, max combo, pp and every judgement, slider ends and spinners included.
  Close it with the X, Escape, or a click beside it. Global Rank and the watch count are left
  out: they come from osu!'s leaderboards, which a local profile does not have.
- **Download Replay**, in the same menu and on the card: saves the score's replay to your
  Downloads folder, byte for byte the file osu! wrote, named as osu!lazer names an exported
  replay. Offered whenever osu! recorded a replay for the score.
- **Every score has its own page**, at `localhost:7272/scores/<number>` -- this app's version of
  osu!'s `osu.ppy.sh/scores/<number>`. **Copy link** in a score's View Details menu puts the
  address on the clipboard; paste it into the browser to open the score on a page of its own.
  The link keeps working after you switch to another profile.
- **Save screenshot** and **Copy screenshot**, in the same menu on the pop-up and on the
  score's page: the score card as a picture, cover art and all, saved to your downloads or put
  straight on the clipboard to paste into a message. Made by the Chrome or Edge already on
  your computer, as the profile's own screenshot is.
- **osu!'s audio player bar.** Playing a Favorite Beatmaps preview brings up osu!'s bar in the
  bottom-right corner: previous and next (through your favourites), play / pause, the clip's
  progress and time -- drag it to seek -- a volume slider with mute, and osu!'s "play next
  track automatically" button. It slides away a few seconds after the music stops. Your
  volume, mute and autoplay choices are remembered by the browser.
- **Pausing a preview now pauses it.** Pressing a playing card's button pauses the clip, and
  pressing it again carries on from where it stopped, as on osu! -- it used to stop and start
  over.

## 1.7.0

- **Beatmaps: Favorite Beatmaps**, the section from osu!'s own profile page. Favourite any
  beatmap from the **...** menu on a row in Scores or Recent Plays, and it appears as osu!'s
  card: its cover, title, artist and mapper, its status, a dot for every difficulty in its
  colour, and osu!'s Explicit, Featured Artist and Spotlight badges. Hover the dots to see
  every difficulty's name and star rating; hover the card for the heart (unfavourite) and
  download. Six at first, then 50 at a time, as on osu!.
  - Favourites are each profile's own, and never sent to osu!. Favouriting asks
    osu.ppy.sh for that beatmap's details once; with no connection it is still saved, and
    the card shows what is on your machine until it can be filled in.
  - **Play a preview** of any favourite from the play button on its cover, as on osu!: osu!'s
    own short clip, streamed only when you press play. One plays at a time; press again to
    stop. Explicit beatmaps have no play button, as on osu!.
  - **Video and storyboard icons** on the cover of any beatmap that has them.
- **Sections are ordered me!, Recent, Scores, Historical, Beatmaps, Medals by default.**
  A section added in a new version now joins a rearranged page after the section it follows
  by default, instead of at the very bottom.

- **The rank graph and stats band is darker, as on osu!.** It shared the header's and the
  level bar's hue, so the top of the page read as one block. It is now osu!'s darker page
  colour between the two, and the stats card stands out on it as the lighter panel it is on
  osu!.

- **Renaming your first profile no longer brings an empty copy back.** The app re-created a
  profile under the name in `data/config.json` on every start, so after renaming the first
  one, the next launch quietly added an empty profile under its old name. It now only uses
  that name when there are no profiles at all. An empty extra profile left behind by this can
  be deleted from **Options -> Profiles**.
- `scripts/reingest.mjs` with no argument now works on the profile that is active, and a
  profile named on the command line must already exist.

## 1.6.0

- **Starting the app opens the page in your default browser.** It was always meant to, and
  on Windows it never did: the command that opens the browser reached Windows garbled, so
  nothing happened and you had to type `localhost:7272` yourself. Fixed, and checked against
  a real browser.
- **Options -> Open in browser on start** turns that off (or back on). It is on by default,
  and it applies to the whole app rather than one profile -- it is saved in
  `data/config.json` as `openBrowser`.

## 1.5.0

### A new name: osu! local profiles

The app, the repository and every download are now **osu! local profiles**. The launcher is
`Start osu! local profiles.bat` (`.command` on macOS). Nothing about your data changes: it
stays in `data/`, and an update never touches that folder.

**Updating from 1.3.0 or 1.4.0 means downloading this version once by hand**: unzip it and
copy your existing `data/` folder into it. Those versions look for a download under the
app's previous name, which releases no longer carry. From 1.5.0 on, the update button works
as before.

### The page matches osu!'s more closely

- **Medals, pp and Total Play Time** under the rank graph, as on osu!, in place of pp,
  Ranked Beatmaps and Bonus pp. The medal count is the whole profile's, across modes. Play
  time is counted with osu!'s own rule -- each play adds the map's length at the speed it
  was played, or the time actually spent in it if you quit, whichever is less.
- **Top Ranks is now Scores**, and **Pinned is now Pinned Scores**. With nothing pinned,
  that space is simply empty.
- **The Medals section is laid out as osu!'s**: one *Skill & Dedication* group of icons, a
  row per family, with no names, dates, counts or progress bars on the page. Hovering a
  medal opens osu!'s card -- the group, the medal, its description, and when you achieved
  it.
- **New medals appear in Recent**, and the page says so the moment one is unlocked.
- **Grade, mod and level lettering is larger and a little darker**, so it sits in its badge
  the way osu!'s does.
- **A new tab icon**: a house on osu!'s pink.

### Removed

- **Sharing the live page on your network.** The page can reset and delete profiles
  without asking who is calling, so it now only ever answers the machine it runs on.
  `shareOnNetwork` in an existing `config.json` is ignored. Saving the profile as a web page
  or an image is unchanged.

## 1.4.0

### Fixed

- **An update no longer leaves 400MB behind.** Updating to 1.3.0 left *two* whole copies of
  the app on disk: the `.rollback-` folder beside it, and a staged copy inside
  `data/update/` that was never cleaned up at all. On a real install that was **406MB**.
  - The rollback is now deleted by the update itself, the moment the new version is in place
    and verified. It still exists during the swap -- that is the window where an interrupted
    update would otherwise leave a hole -- so an update that is cut short can still be undone
    by hand. It just no longer sits there afterwards.
  - The staged copy is cleared at the next start, because the updater is running from it and
    cannot delete itself.
  - Starting the app also clears anything an earlier version left, and says how much it
    reclaimed. Upgrading from 1.3.0 will tidy up after 1.3.0 on its own.
  - `data/update.log` is kept: it is the record of what the last update did.

## 1.3.0

### The page looks like osu!'s

- **Country flags.** The flag beside your name is now the flag, not just the two-letter
  code — and the country's full name is written beside it, as osu! writes it. The whole set
  is bundled, so it works with no network for any country. It is the same artwork osu! uses:
  both come from Twemoji.
- **SS and S are gold again.** osu!'s badges carry a gradient on the letter, and it is the
  gradient — gold, or silver for the hidden variants — that tells the two apart. Only the
  silver one had been implemented, so SS and S were falling back to a flat dark letter and
  reading as washed out.
- **Mod badges are osu!'s.** The angled hexagon in the mod type's colour, the acronym
  darkened into it, a tab on the right carrying the rate for a sped-up or slowed-down play,
  and a cog when anything about the mod was customised. Tooltips now say `Double Time (1.3×)`
  rather than listing raw setting keys.
- **Mod colours are right, not approximately right.** The acronym-to-type table was
  hand-written; it is now generated from osu!'s own mod definitions, so every one of the 69
  mods gets the colour osu! gives it.

### Updating, and a few smaller things

- **One-click updates.** When a newer release exists, an **Update available** button appears
  beside the tracking indicator. It shows what you are on and what you would get, then
  downloads, installs and restarts the app for you.
  - Your `data/` folder -- the database, your settings, your avatar and banner -- is never
    touched. The files being replaced are *moved* to a `.rollback-<date>` folder beside the
    app rather than deleted, so a failed update can be undone by hand. `data/update.log`
    records what happened.
  - Nothing is swapped until the download has been unpacked and checked to be the version it
    claimed. A copy running from a source checkout refuses outright, since an "update" there
    would overwrite your working tree.
  - One request, at startup, and never on a timer. Set `"checkForUpdates": false` in
    `data/config.json` and the app makes no network request of its own at all.
- **Dialogs taller than the window now scroll.** Settings had grown past the bottom of the
  screen on shorter displays, and because the backdrop is fixed, neither it nor the page
  behind it could scroll to reach the rest.
- **The warning in Top Ranks can be dismissed.** The line saying this profile's pp is not
  comparable with a real osu! account now has a **Don't show again** and an **X**. It is
  remembered per profile, and can be turned back on from Settings. The affected scores keep
  their `*` either way.
- **A footer**, with the running version and a link to the source.

### For contributors

- **`docs/osu-web-fidelity.md`** maps every region of the profile page to the osu-web file
  that defines it, and sets out what may be taken from osu! and what may not. Matching osu!
  more closely should no longer take several passes per detail.
- `npm run build:flags` and `npm run build:mods` regenerate the bundled flags and the mod
  table. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` records where both came from.

## 1.2.0

### Fixed

- **The file watcher could kill the app outright on Windows.** `fs.watch` was given the osu!
  directory as configured, and libuv *aborts the process* -- not an error, an `abort()` --
  when that path is not the canonical one: a junction, a drive substitution, or an 8.3 short
  name. Both watchers resolve the path first now. Found by CI, whose temp directory is
  exactly such a short name; every local run had passed.

### The page behaves like osu!'s

- **Recent, Top Ranks, Most Played Beatmaps and Recent Plays start at five rows**, with a
  **show more** button that expands to 25 and then 25 at a time. Paging is served rather
  than done in the browser, so a profile with thousands of plays opens with twenty rows and
  expanding still works however long the list is.
- **The rank graph is osu!'s yellow** (`#ffcc22` at 2px, from osu-web's
  `.line-chart--profile-page`) instead of the page's pink.
- **The rank graph reads out on hover**: `Global Ranking #120,000` over `40 days ago`, at
  daily granularity, snapping to real recorded points rather than interpolating between
  them.
- **Monthly Playcounts is now Play History** -- its actual name on osu! -- drawn as a yellow
  line rather than bars, and hoverable for `Plays 430` over `March 2020`.
- The hover marker and tooltip are HTML drawn over the chart rather than SVG inside it: the
  charts stretch to their container, which would render a circle as an ellipse. osu-web does
  the same, for the same reason.

### macOS and Linux

Written, and covered by CI on `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` alongside Windows. **Not
yet run against a real osu! install on either**, so they are supported-but-unproven; the
README says so and `docs/roadmap.md` 5.10 lists what still needs a real machine.

- **Detection** takes the platform, home directory and environment as an argument instead of
  reading `process`, so the paths it looks in are a pure function and can be tested for a
  platform this project has never run on. `os.homedir()` replaces `$HOME` -- unset, it used
  to look in a directory literally called `undefined` -- and `XDG_DATA_HOME` is honoured.
- **osu!stable under Wine** is looked for in the Wineskin bundles, plain and `WINEPREFIX`
  prefixes, CrossOver bottles and osu-winello. osu-winello records the install path it was
  given, so that is read rather than guessed at. A missing Wine prefix is never an error.
- **`installRoots` in `config.json` now works.** It was documented, and named in the "no
  osu! found" message as the thing to set, and read by nothing. A configured folder is
  classified by what is inside it, so you do not also have to say which client it is.
- **The packaged build** gets a `.command` on macOS and an executable `start.sh` on Linux,
  and a `README.txt` for that platform -- including that macOS will refuse the first launch
  because the build is unsigned, and the two ways round it. Building a package for a
  different OS than the one you are on is refused rather than producing an archive that
  starts on nothing.
- **The pp helper's pruning** matches native libraries by base name across
  `.dll`/`.dylib`/`.so`. It deleted a hardcoded list of `.dll` names before, so a macOS or
  Linux build would have matched nothing and silently shipped a 273MB helper rather than a
  114MB one -- BASS included, which is not ours to redistribute.
- **`--check-only`** reports whether osu! was found *and* whether the pp calculator starts,
  rather than stopping at the first problem.
- **`npm run ui`** finds a browser on all three platforms, and on `PATH`, instead of two
  hardcoded Windows paths.
- On Linux, the recursive file watch is one inotify watch per directory and lazer's store is
  thousands of them, so hitting the limit is plausible. It now says that is what happened
  and how to raise it, rather than reporting a bare `ENOSPC`, which reads as "disk full".

### Plays that were never finished

Until now the profile only knew about plays osu!lazer kept a replay for -- which means
plays you finished. osu! counts a play you quit, retried or failed too, and lazer saves a
score only for a map played to the end, so those left nothing to detect. Measured on one
real session: **54 plays started, 45 counted by osu!, 19 replays written.** The play count
was missing well over half of itself.

- Unfinished plays are now tracked, read from lazer's own session log -- still no API, no
  credentials and no polling. A play is counted at the moment the log records osu!
  accepting the submission, so the play count agrees with the website by construction
  rather than by reimplementing its rules, and both go quiet together when you play offline.
- They count toward the **play count**, the **monthly play counts** and **Most Played**.
  That is not a setting: osu! counts them, so this does.
- They appear in **Recent Plays** as dimmed rows marked "Didn't finish". The new setting
  **Unfinished plays in Recent** chooses between grouping a consecutive run of attempts on
  one beatmap into a single row with its count (the default), listing every attempt, and
  hiding them.
- There is no accuracy, combo, mod list or pp on these rows, and none is invented: lazer
  records none of it for a play it discards. `hits per play` still divides by scored plays
  for the same reason.
- Resetting or deleting a profile clears them along with its scores.

Along the way, two things worth knowing were established from ppy/osu and this machine's
2,433-replay corpus, and are written down in `CLAUDE.md`:

- osu! applies **no minimum object count** to a play. It submits a fail or a quit as long as
  a token was issued, at least one non-miss judgement landed, and the score is above zero.
- Every rank-`F` replay on disk is a **multiplayer** play, where failing only marks the
  score `F` instead of ending the map. All 22 of them judged 100% of their beatmap; there is
  no such thing as a partially-played replay in the store.

osu!stable is not covered: it has the same gap, but where a stable install records an
unfinished play -- if it does at all -- could not be established without one to inspect.
`docs/roadmap.md` **5.12** holds the leads, what is already ruled out, and the measurement
to run first.

## 1.1.0

Phase 5: the profile becomes yours to configure, arrange and share.

Planned feature by feature in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md), where 5.0 to 5.9 are
done. macOS and Linux support (5.10) is deferred to a phase of its own -- it is the only
item that cannot be verified on the development machine.

### Settings

- A Settings dialog, reached from Options. Settings belong to a profile, not to the app:
  two playstyles are two profiles and should not share a country, a description, or how
  their scores are counted.
- Country and playstyle are editable from the page. They previously needed `config.json`
  edited by hand and the app restarted. `config.json` is now the fallback for a profile
  that has never set them; once a profile sets one, clearing it stays cleared.

### Counting unranked mods

- **Include pp for unranked mods**, off by default. Counts plays osu! refuses to rank
  because of their mods: Relax, Autopilot, and customised rates such as DT at 1.45x.
- Relax and Autopilot can be priced either **as if the mod were off** (the default -- relax
  counts as nomod, relax + DT counts as DT) or **as osu! scores them**. Both numbers come
  from osu!'s own calculators, and both are stored, so switching between them is instant.
  They are far apart: 111pp against 239pp on one real replay, because a relax run reaches
  accuracy and combo the player could not by hand.
- Wherever the profile is not scoring the way osu! would, it says so -- once above Best
  Performance, and on every affected row.
- **Fixed:** a mod with customised settings was stored as ranked because only its acronym
  was checked. A score set on DT at 1.45x, or HT at 0.5x, counted as if it were the default
  mod. Both exist in a real replay corpus, so this was not hypothetical.
- pp is now calculated for every score that can be calculated, not only ranked ones, and
  whether a score counts is decided when the profile is read. Changing a setting is
  instant and reversible rather than a reingest.
- **Recompute**: scores tracked before this release have no pp for anything osu! would not
  rank. The Settings dialog offers to recalculate them from their replay files. Rows are
  updated in place, and a score whose replay has been deleted is left alone.

### Counting unranked beatmaps

- **Include pp for unranked beatmaps**, none by default. Loved, Qualified, Pending, Work in
  progress, Graveyarded and Never submitted are each a separate choice, because they are not
  the same proposition -- a Loved map is played competitively, a graveyarded one may be a
  draft nobody finished, and a never-submitted one exists only on your machine.
- Independent of the mod setting: a Loved map played with Relax needs both before it counts.

### Sharing

- **Options -> Share this profile**, with three ways out:
  - **A standalone `.html` file** -- one file, opens anywhere, needs neither this app nor a
    connection. Built from the live page rather than re-rendered on the server, so it
    captures exactly what is on screen, section order included.
  - **A full-page PNG**, rendered by an already-installed Chrome or Edge. Nothing is
    bundled: a headless browser would dwarf the whole 83MB app. Without one, the button
    says so and points at the HTML export.
  - **The live page on your local network**, off by default.

### Security: the server no longer listens to the whole network by default

- **Behaviour change.** The server used to listen on every interface, so anyone on the same
  network could open the profile -- and also reset it, delete a profile, or remove scores,
  since none of those endpoints asks who is calling. Requests that are not from this
  machine are now refused, and sharing is opt-in via `"shareOnNetwork": true` in
  `data/config.json`.
- Enforced per request rather than by binding to `127.0.0.1`: a host-bound listen also cuts
  off IPv6 loopback, and `localhost` resolves to `::1` first on Windows, so binding
  "safely" would have left the app unreachable from its own browser.

### Medals

- A Medals section mirroring osu!'s: combo, plays, hits, rank, and beatmap pass and full
  combo by star rating.
- Names, descriptions, icons and thresholds are **osu!'s own**, taken from its published
  achievement list by `node scripts/build-medal-table.mjs` rather than typed out. That is
  also how it came to light that combo and play-count medals exist for osu!standard only,
  that the other modes have hit-count medals in their place, and that star tiers run to 10
  for osu!standard and to 8 elsewhere.
- Derived from the scores rather than stored, so removing a score that earned a medal takes
  the medal with it, and a reingest can never leave a stale one behind.
- Full combo requires the beatmap's own maximum combo, not merely no misses: a lazer score
  can drop slider ends without breaking combo. Scores tracked before that was recorded are
  reported as unknown rather than guessed, and the section says how many.
- osu!'s medal icons load over a drawn placeholder, so the section is complete offline.

### Rearranging the page

- Sections can be reordered, and the order is saved with the profile -- as osu! remembers
  the arrangement of your own page. Drag by the grip, or use the arrows beside it.
- The saved order is reconciled against the code's own list on every read: ids that no
  longer exist are dropped, and new ones are appended. Adding a section later can therefore
  never leave a saved order stale or make a section unreachable.

### The me! section

- osu!'s description box, at the top of the profile. Click to edit; per profile.
- **Plain text, not BBCode.** Line breaks are kept and bare URLs become links; everything
  else renders as the characters that were typed. osu!'s BBCode subset is large, and a
  local profile gains nothing from an HTML sanitiser it would have to get exactly right.
- URLs are found in the raw text and escaped individually rather than the text being
  escaped first and matched afterwards -- escaping first turns a typed quote into an entity
  the URL pattern does not stop at, so the match runs through it and swallows the rest of
  the line into the link.

### Editing the profile

- **Options -> Edit profile**, or click the avatar or the name. Sets the profile's name,
  picture and banner.
- Pictures and banners are **per profile** rather than per install, so two playstyles are
  two identities. A hand-placed `data/avatar.png` from before this still works, as the
  fallback for any profile that has not set its own.
- Upload a PNG, JPEG, WebP or GIF. Uploads are sniffed rather than trusted: the type the
  browser reports is whatever the page chose to send.
- **Borrow from an osu! account** by username, user id or profile link. It shows what it
  found before applying anything, then copies the picture and banner into `data/` so the
  page still works with no network afterwards.
- **Still no login and no API key.** The lookup reads the public profile page, which embeds
  the same user object osu!'s API returns. One request per button press, never on a timer.
- If osu! is signed in, its username is offered as a suggestion, read from the client's own
  config file with no network. It only prefills: a local profile is a different identity by
  definition, so it is never adopted without being asked for.

### Pinning and removing scores

- Every score row has a **⋯** menu, matching the one on osu!'s own profile.
- **Pin to profile** adds it to a new **Pinned** section above Best Performance. Pins are
  per game mode and do not have to be top-100 plays -- pinning is for a play you are proud
  of that pp does not reward, so an unranked or relax score can be pinned too.
- Pinned scores can be dragged to reorder, or moved with the menu for anyone not using a
  mouse. The order is saved.
- **Remove from profile** -- which osu! itself has no equivalent for -- takes a score out of
  every section and every total: pp, play count, ranked score, level, the charts, Most
  Played, the mode tabs.
- Removing never deletes. The score can be put back from Settings, under *Removed scores*.
  A real delete would be re-imported from the replay still on disk, and with its dedupe key
  gone it would return looking like a brand new play.

### Development

- `npm run build:pp:local` refreshes `tools/pp/`, which `src/calc/official.ts` prefers over
  the plain build output. A stale copy there does not fail loudly -- it answers the old
  protocol -- so the publish-and-prune step is now shared with `npm run package` rather
  than duplicated.

## 1.0.0

First complete release. Tracks an alternative osu! playstyle as a brand new profile,
entirely locally, with pp that matches osu! to the digit.

### Tracking

- Watches osu!lazer and osu!stable for new replays and turns them into tracked scores,
  usually within a second of finishing a play.
- Works **offline and logged out**, which is the whole reason it reads local files rather
  than the osu! API: an unsubmitted play never appears in the API, even after reconnecting.
- Reads lazer's extended replay block directly, since existing parsers get it wrong —
  one reported rank `F` for a play that actually ranked A.
- Resolves beatmaps offline from lazer's `online.db`, so ranked status needs no network.
- Never scans and imports on startup. Only live plays count, unless you explicitly ask.

### pp

- Comes from **osu!'s own difficulty and performance code**, handed the replay file so
  osu!stable scores are correctly decoded as legacy and scored with the Classic mod.
- No fallback calculator, on purpose. When the helper is unavailable the app stores no pp
  rather than a wrong one, and says so loudly.

### The profile page

- Rebuilt to match `osu.ppy.sh`'s profile design, on osu-web's own colour token system.
- Ranking panel, grade badges, level bar, Recent, Top Ranks and Historical, with mod pills,
  cover art and charts.
- Plain HTML, CSS and ES modules — no build step.

### Rank

- Global rank estimated offline from a pp-to-rank curve built from osu!'s public
  data.ppy.sh sample of the whole ladder. All four modes included.
- Country rank is deliberately not shown: there is nothing accurate to derive it from, and
  a fabricated number would be worse than a dash.

### Profiles and data

- Several playstyles side by side, each with its own scores, pp, level and start date.
- Import plays made while the app was closed, with an explicit cutoff and a preview.
- Export a profile as JSON, or back up every profile.

### Packaging

- `npm run package` produces a portable build: **83MB to download**, nothing to install.
- osu!'s dependency tree is pruned — 273MB to about 112MB — removing fonts, textures,
  audio samples and unused native libraries. Notably the native BASS binaries are excluded:
  BASS is commercially licensed and this app never plays a sound.
- The packaging step starts the built artifact from an unrelated directory and refuses to
  finish unless it reports finding its pp calculator.

### Known limits

- Only osu!standard is verified against known-correct pp values.
- A beatmap you have never downloaded cannot be scored; pp needs the local `.osu`.
- Rank is an estimate and drifts as the playerbase grows; refresh with `npm run rank:refresh`.
- Windows is the only packaged target so far.
