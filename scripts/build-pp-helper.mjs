/**
 * Publish the self-contained osu! pp helper into a directory, pruned to what a pp
 * calculator actually needs.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-pp-helper.mjs [outDir] [--rid win-x64]
 *
 * With no arguments this refreshes `tools/pp/`, which is what `src/calc/official.ts`
 * prefers over the plain `dotnet build` output. Keeping that directory current matters more
 * than it looks: an out-of-date helper there does not fail loudly, it answers the *old*
 * protocol and quietly returns values calculated the old way. `npm run package` calls the
 * same function, so the shipped helper and the development one can never diverge.
 *
 * Most of the work is *removing* things. osu!'s NuGet packages carry the whole game: fonts,
 * textures, audio samples, ffmpeg, SDL, a shader compiler and native binaries for Android,
 * iOS, Linux and macOS. Dropping what a pp calculator cannot use takes the helper from
 * 273MB to about 114MB.
 *
 * What can go is narrower than it looks. osu.Framework's `Logger` static constructor drags
 * in nearly the whole *managed* graph -- NUnit, OpenTabletDriver, Sentry, the lot -- so
 * removing any managed assembly kills the helper at startup. What is safe is the things
 * loaded lazily: the resources assembly, localisation satellites, and native libraries
 * reached through P/Invoke only when something actually plays audio or opens a window.
 *
 * Each entry below was verified against a build with no fallback available. That detail
 * matters: `official.ts` falls back to the plain build output, so an early attempt at this
 * list "passed" the pp tests while shipping a helper that could not start at all.
