/**
 * Generate `web/js/mod-definitions.js` - every mod's name, type and setting labels.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `scripts/build-medal-table.mjs`: take the facts from osu! rather than
 * writing them out by hand. The table this replaces was a hand-kept acronym -> type
 * mapping that its own comment called "rough", and the type is what picks a mod's colour,
 * so a wrong entry is a visibly wrong badge.
 *
 * The source is osu-web's `database/mods.json`, which osu-web itself generates from the
 * game's mod definitions. Only the acronym, display name, type and setting labels are
 * kept -- facts about osu!, the same class of thing as the colour tables in
 * docs/osu-web-reference.md. Descriptions and per-ruleset duplicates are dropped.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/build-mod-table.mjs
