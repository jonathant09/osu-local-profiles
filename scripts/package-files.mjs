 *
 * All three do the same two things: move to the folder they are in, then run the app with
 * the Node runtime sitting beside them. Moving first is the part that matters -- a launcher
 * started by double-clicking begins in whatever directory the file manager felt like, and
 * without it the app would look for its `data/` somewhere else entirely and silently start
 * from scratch.
 *
 * macOS gets `.command` because that is the extension Finder runs on a double-click; a
 * `.sh` would open in a text editor. Linux desktops run an executable `.sh` directly.
