/**
 * The one-click update.
 *
 * Three things make this safe enough to exist at all, and none of them should be removed:
 *
 * 1. **`data/` is never touched.** It lives *inside* the install (see `config.dataDir`), so
 *    the swap works on the install's other top-level entries and steps around that one.
 *    Everything the user has -- the database, their avatar, their config -- is in there.
 * 2. **Nothing is deleted while it could still be needed.** The files being replaced are
 *    *moved* into `.rollback-<stamp>/`, so a swap that dies half way leaves both halves on
 *    disk instead of a hole. The swap removes that copy once the new build is verified in
 *    place, and `pruneUpdateLeftovers` sweeps anything a failed swap left, at startup.
 * 3. **Nothing is swapped until the new build is verified on disk**: downloaded, unpacked,
 *    and checked to be the version it claimed with the files an install needs.
 *
 * It also refuses to run against a source checkout. `start.bat` runs `node src/main.ts` from
 * the repository, and an "update" there would overwrite someone's working tree with a
 * release zip.

 * same terminal, where Ctrl+C and closing the window still stop the app.
 *
 * Before this the swapper started the app itself, and on those platforms a process it starts
 * has no terminal: the app came back running, invisible, and with nothing to stop it. The
