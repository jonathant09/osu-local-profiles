/**
 * The medals a profile has earned, derived from its scores.
 *
 * **Derived, never stored.** The same reasoning as `history.ts`: a reingest, a removed
 * score, or a settings change must not leave a medal behind that the profile can no longer
 * justify. So they are recomputed from the scores every time, and the date on a medal is
 * the date of the first score that satisfied it.
 *
 * The definitions -- names, descriptions, icons, thresholds -- come from osu!'s own
 * achievement list, rebuilt by `scripts/build-medal-table.mjs`. What exists is not the same
 * in every mode: combo and play-count medals are osu!standard's, the other modes have
 * hit-count medals instead, and star pass/FC medals run 1..10 for osu!standard and 1..8
 * elsewhere. That asymmetry is osu!'s, and is reproduced rather than smoothed over.
 *
 * Two families are only as good as their inputs, and say so:
 * - **Rank** medals use the estimated pp-to-rank curve, so they inherit its approximation.
 * - **FC** medals need the beatmap's own maximum combo, which is only stored for scores
 *   ingested since that column existed. Older scores can be filled in by a recompute.
