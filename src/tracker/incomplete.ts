/**
 * Turning a play read out of lazer's log into a tracked one.
 *
 * These are the plays the replay watcher can never see -- a quit, a retry, or an HP fail
 * outside multiplayer. What is knowable about them is only what the log says: which beatmap,
 * when, and whether osu! could submit it. There is no accuracy, no combo, no mod list and no
 * pp, because lazer never writes any of it down. Nothing here invents a substitute for the
 * missing numbers.
 *
 * Two kinds arrive, and both are stored in `incomplete_plays`, never in `scores`:
 *
 * - **A play osu! counted** -- its submission completed. These always count, because osu!
 *   counts them.
 * - **An attempt osu! could not submit** -- `No token` -- stored with `unsubmitted = 1`. osu!
 *   never saw these, so whether this profile counts them is its own setting, read through
 *   `incompleteSql()` in src/calc/eligibility.ts. They are recorded either way, because the
 *   log is only ever followed live: an attempt skipped today could not be recovered by
 *   switching the setting on tomorrow.
 *
 * Each kind has a `check` and an `ingest`. The check does everything but write -- it is what
 * Import past plays previews with -- and the ingest is the check followed by the write, so a
 * preview can never promise a play the import then refuses.
