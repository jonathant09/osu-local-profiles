/**
 * Past unfinished plays, read back out of osu!lazer's session logs for Import past plays.
 *
 * The live watcher follows a log from its current end, so a play made while this app was closed
 * exists only in a log already on disk. Reading those is the same decision as importing past
 * replays, and it gets the same treatment: an explicit cutoff, a preview, a confirmation, and
 * never on startup -- a profile must not quietly absorb plays made with someone's normal
 * playstyle.
 *
 * Both kinds come back: plays osu! counted (`Score submission completed!`) and attempts osu! could
 * not submit (`No token`). A pass is left out, because lazer imported it and it is a replay,
 * which Import past plays reads on its own.
