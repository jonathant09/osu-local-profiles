/**
 * Which plays are tracked at all.
 *
 * Every other setting in this app decides how a stored play is *read* -- whether it counts
 * toward pp, which score scale it shows on -- and can therefore be changed at any time with
 * nothing but a redraw. This one is different in kind: a play the filter rejects is never
 * written down, so the decision is made once, at ingest, and cannot be revisited. That is
 * the point of it (someone tracking a mouse-only profile does not want their tablet warmup
 * in it), and it is why the filter starts switched off and, when switched on, starts with
 * every criterion wide open -- turning it on must change nothing until something is narrowed.
 *
 * Two rules follow from having no second chance:
 *
 * - **An unknowable criterion never rejects a play.** Over half of what osu! counts as a
 *   play leaves no replay -- a quit, an HP fail, a retry -- and those have no mod list and no
 *   star rating recorded anywhere (see src/tracker/incomplete.ts). The other seven criteria
 *   still judge them. Dropping what cannot be fully judged would make the profile's play
 *   count disagree with osu!'s the moment the filter came on, which is a worse answer than a
 *   filter that admits what it cannot see.
 * - **Nothing here is derived from a stored score.** Every fact the filter tests comes from
 *   the replay, the `.osu` file or `online.db`, so the same filter gives the same answer at
 *   live ingest and during Import past plays.
 */
