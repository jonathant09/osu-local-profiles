/**
 * The username osu! is currently signed in as, read from the client's own config file.
 *
 * This is the offline half of identity: it needs no network and no account link, and it is
 * almost always the name the user actually wants. It is only ever used to *prefill* -- a
 * local profile is a different identity by definition, so adopting the real one silently
 * would be wrong.
 *
 * Read-only and best effort. A missing file, an unreadable one, or an osu! that has never
 * been signed in all mean the same thing: there is nothing to suggest.
 *
 * - osu!lazer writes `game.ini` beside its database, with `Username = ...`.
 * - osu!stable writes `osu!.<windows-username>.cfg` in its install directory, same key.
